<div class="article">
 <div class="strong">Hi, my name is Thomas Seal and this where I bring my most creative side to life.</div>
<div class="body">What began as a sudden interest in typography (which probably wasn’t very sudden at all) quickly escalated into a fevered obsession with all things graphic design. This combined with my natural love of words and desire to communicate could only lead to me building a website, e voilà!
I created maxwell.life to be a space for me to share my thoughts and ideas, to help me grow creatively and find my voice. This is just a humble beginning, but I’m super excited to finally have a piece of the web to call my own. Stay and read as much or as little as you like, and if the mood takes you, you can pass on feedback to: (email coming soon)
P.S. This site is still very much a work in progress, so feel free to send me your thoughts about its design too.
